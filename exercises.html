        <h3>CHEST</h3>
        <p>BARBELL BENCH PRESS: Position yourself with your back down on a flat bench placing the hands up on the bar using an underhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
            After taking a deep breath in, extend the elbows and lift the bar up off the rack until elbows are extended but not locked. Pause for a brief movement as you fully extend your breath.
            Lower the weight directly down to the chest as you breath inwards, keeping the movement pattern slow and steady.
            Once just above the chest, pause, and then press directly up again, exhaling your breath.
            Continue until all reps are completed and then re-rack the barbell.</p>
        <p>DUMBBELL FLYES: Pick up dumbbells and hold them above you with a slight bend in the elbow.
            Keeping the dumbbells in line with your chest, slowly open up your arms to the sides.
            Stop when your upper arms are parallel with the floor.
            Squeeze your chest muscles and slowly return to starting position. Repeat.</p>
        <p>PUSH UPS: Get into position by placing your hands flat on the floor, directly below your shoulders.
            Extend your legs out behind you, with only your toes and balls of your feet touching the floor.
            Hold your body up and keep your back straight by tightening your abdominal muscles.
            Your neck and head should be bent slightly back.
            Lower your chest towards the ground by bending your elbows until your chest is just above the ground or you feel a stretching of your chest and shoulders. Hold for a count of one.
            Press upwards from your chest and shoulders, straightening your arms as you return to the starting position. Hold for a count of one.
            Repeat.</p>
        <p>DECLINE PUSH UPS: Facing down, place yourself on the ground with your hands flat on the floor, directly below your shoulders.
            Place your feet on top of a bench or box. Only your toes and balls of your feet should be touching the floor.
            Maintain a flat back and tight core before lowering your chest towards the ground. Bend your elbows at a 60-degree angle until your chest is just above the ground. You should feel a stretch across your chest. Hold for a count of one.
            Push yourself back to the starting position by straightening your arms. Do not lock out your elbows.
            Repeat.</p>
        <p>INCLINE PUSH UPS: Set up a bench or stable elevated surface. Begin with both hands on the bench at shoulder-width or just outside of shoulder-width.
            Place your feet straight behind you while you tighten your abs and engage the hips. Your hips should not dip or elevate too high during the movement.
            Slowly lower yourself towards the bench. Once your upper arms are parallel with the floor, pause, and return to the starting position.</p>
        <p>INCLINE BARBELL BENCH PRESS: Set up an incline bench in front of a weight rack, making sure you adjust the incline to a comfortable position. The back of the bench should be facing the weight stack.
            Sit on the bench placing your back firmly against the backrest.
            Using an overhand grip, grasp the bar with your hands spaced about twice your shoulder-width apart.
            Lift the bar from the rack by pushing up with your chest muscles and hold it straight over your chest with your arms fully extended. This is the start position.
            As you inhale, lower the barbell slowly until it touches your upper chest.
            Hold for a count of one while squeezing your chest muscles.
            Return to the start position as you exhale, pushing the bar using your chest muscles. Hold for a count of one.
            Repeat.</p>
        <p>DECLINE BARBELL BENCH PRESS: Set a barbell in a weight rack at the low end of a decline bench,making sure it is at a height you can reach without fully extending your arms.
            Secure your feet under the stirrup, bar or strap at the high end of the bench and lie flat on your back with the rack slightly behind you.
            Using an overhand grip, grip the bar with your hands about twice your shoulder-width apart.
            Push up to lift the bar from the rack and hold it directly over you with your arms locked. Your arms should be at 90 degrees to the floor. This is the start position.
            Bend your elbows to slowly lower the barbell until it touches our chest, inhaling as you do so.
            Hold for a count of one.
            Return to the start position by pushing the bar using your chest muscles, exhaling as you do so.
            At the top of the movement, lock your arms and squeeze your chest muscles.
            Hold for a count of one. Repeat.</p>
        <p>FARMER'S CARRY: Place a pair of dumbbells or kettlebells at your feet. Brace your core and keep your chest up as you kneel down. Pick the dumbbells up, maintaining your form and keeping your gaze straight ahead.
            Standing up, walk forward in a straight line, holding the dumbbells at your sides.
            The trick is to use very heavy dumbbells. Walk as far as you can then set the weights down. Take a short break and repeat going back the other way.</p>
        <p>TRICEPS DIPS: Standing between the bars of a dip station, grip the bars with an overhand grip,keeping your elbows tucked in close to your body.
            Allow your body weigh to hang so it is being supported by your arms and shoulders. Keep your hips straight.
            Push down through your palms with your arms, lifting your body up until your arms are almost straight. (Do not lock your elbows)
            Lower your body by slowly bending your elbows and continue down until you feel a slight stretch in your shoulders.
            Pause, then push yourself back to the starting position.
            Repeat.</p>
        <p>DUMBBELL BENCH PRESS: Lie on a flat bench holding a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip.
            Start by holding the dumbbells slightly wider than shoulder-width apart above your shoulders. Your palms should be facing forward.
            Slowly bend your elbows until they are at a 90 degree angle and your upper arms are parallel to the ground.
            Push the weights up by straightening your arms.
            As you push the weights up, move your arms in an arc to bring the dumbbells together, until they meet over the center of your chest. Hold for a count of one.
            Lower the dumbbells by slowly bending your elbows back to 90 degrees.
            Continue lowering your arms until they are a little lower than parallel to the floor. (Your elbows should be pointing slightly towards the floor and you should feel a stretch in your chest muscles and shoulders.)
            Repeat.</p>
        <p>DECLINE DUMBBELL PRESS: Sit on a decline bench and place your feet under the leg brace. Rest a dumbbell on each thigh.
            Grab hold of the dumbbells with an overhand grip and lie back on the bench.
            Position the dumbbells on either side of your chest. Your palms should face outwards and your arms should be bent under each weight.
            Slowly press the dumbbells up from the elbows until your arms are fully extended over your chest.
            Return to the starting position by lowering the dumbbells to either side of your chest again. You should feel a slight stretch in your chest and shoulders.
            </p>
        <p>INCLINE DUMBBELL PRESS: Set up an incline bench so the back rest is at about a 45 degree angle.
            Hold a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip. (Palms facing away from you)
            Sit on the bench with your feet flat on the floor and your back and shoulders pressed firmly back against the back rest.
            Raise the dumbbells up to your shoulder level, keeping your elbows bent at 90 degrees.
            Push the dumbbells up and away from you using your shoulders and chest while straightening your arms.
            Continue raising the dumbbells until your arms are straight and the dumbbells are suspended above your chest. Hold for a count of one.
            Lower the dumbbells back towards your chest by relaxing your chest and shoulders while bending your elbows.
            Hold for a count of one
            Repeat.</p>
        <p>CABLE CROSSOVER: Stand between two cable stations with the dumbbell grip handles attached to the high pulleys on each side of you.
            Hold the handles with an overhand grip. Your arms should be outstretched.
            Bend your knees and hips slightly so that you are leaning forward, but not too far.
            Bend your elbows slightly and rotate your shoulders in towards the centre of your chest a little. Your elbows should be slightly behind you.
            Use a hugging motion, keeping your elbows in a fixed, bent position to bring the grip attachments together in front of your chest.
            Slowly return to the starting position until you feel a slight stretch in your chest muscles.
            Repeat.</p>
        <p>LOW CABLE CROSSOVER: Adjust the pulley lever to be below you. Stand in the center of the pulley machine while holding both handles. Brace your abdominals and take a step forward.
            With your chest up, bring the handles up and to the front of your body. The handles will meet at shoulder height.
            Pause to feel the contraction in your chest then slowly lower the handles to the starting position.
            </p>
        <p>LANDMINE PRESS: Using a T-Bar, load the amount of weight you’d like to work with (start out lighter to master the form before increasing the load).
            Grip the top of the barbell so that your hands overlap, and your palms are facing inward.
            Squat so that your knees are at a 90 degree bend with the top of the barbell almost resting on your chest. Make sure your elbows are low and close to your body and not flaring out.
            With an explosive movement, push through your legs and drive the end of the barbell away from your body.</p>
        <p>PULLOVER: </p>
        <!--What type of pullover? Barbell, dumbbell, close grip lat?-->
        <p>PLATE PRESS OUT: Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and slighly bent knees. Pick up a weighted play and hold it at chest level with your elbows bent.

        <h3>TRICEPS</h3>
        <p>CLOSE-GRIP BARBELL BENCH PRESS: Lie on a flat bench with your feet flat on the floor. 
            Make sure your back is completely flat on the bench, with no “arching” of your spine.
            Grip the barbell with an overhand grip, shoulder-width or slightly less than shoulder-width apart. 
            (Do not make your grip too narrow as it limits stability of the barbell which can lead to injury)
            Push up using your chest and shoulders to lift the barbell above your body, then lower it slowly 
            ( a count of 2) towards the centre of your chest. 
            Hold for a count of one.
            Without “bouncing” the weight, force the barbell back up over the middle of your chest, 
            straightening your arms and locking your elbows once your arms are fully straight. 
            Hold for a count of one.
            Repeat.</p>
        <p>DECLINE TRICEPS EXTENSION: Set up a decline bench to between 15 and 30 degrees. (The angle is not important, your comfort and form is.)
            Place the EZ bar on the rack at the foot of the bench.
            Sit on the bench and position your feet under the foot pads.
            Lean forward and grip the EZ bar with an overhand grip, shoulder-width apart.
            Lift the bar from the rack. (Because of your position when doing this, I recommend getting a spotter to assist you)
            Lat flat on the bench holding the bar above your chest with your arms extended and elbows locked.
            Lower the EZ bar towards you by bending your arms toward you in a smooth arc. Your upper arms should not move.
            Continue lowering the bar until it is just above or gently touching your forehead. You should feel a stretch in your triceps.
            Hold and squeeze you triceps for a count of one.
            Return to the staring position by extending your arms in a smooth arc. (Again, your upper arms should not move)
            Repeat.</p>
        <p>CABLE PUSH DOWN: Set up a cable station with a straight bar on attached to the top pulley.
            Grip the bar with an overhand grip,with your hands slightly less than shoulder-width apart.

            Pull the bar down until your forearms are parallel to the floor with your elbows close to your body 
            and your wrists locked in a straight position. 
            This is your staring point.
            Moving only your forearms, push the bar down towards the floor until your arms are fully extended 
            and you feel a stretch in your triceps. 
            Hold for a count of one and squeeze your triceps.
            Return to the start position moving your forearms only. Hold for a count of one then repeat.</p>
        <p>DIAMOND PUSH-UP: Position yourself on all fours on a mat.
            Place your hands in front of you and shoulder-width apart.
            Now bring your hands in towards the center until the tips of your index fingers and tips of your thumbs are touching. 
            This creates a diamond shape between your hands. Your elbows and wrists should be in line with your chest.
            With your fingers facing forwards, lift off your knees so that your body forms a straight line and just your hands and toes touch the floor.
            Keep you pelvis straight and abs engaged and aim to keep a straight back throughout the movement.
            Bend your elbows and lower your body towards the floor, aiming to touch your chest to the top of your hands. Pause briefly.
            Return to the starting position by extending your elbows and lifting your body off the floor again.</p>
        <p>LYING BARBELL TRICEP EXTENSION: Place a bench vertically behind you. Holding a barbell, lie down on the bench and 
            plant your feet on the floor on either side of the bench, 
            or on the bench itself — whichever is most comfortable. Extend your arms and hold the barbell directly in front of your chest in an overhand grip 
            (palms facing away from your body). 
            This is your starting position.
            While keeping your shoulders as still as possible, bend your elbows to lower the barbell towards your forehead.
            Using your triceps, extend your elbows to return to the starting position, ensuring that your shoulders, elbows and wrists 
            remain in line with one another at all times. Repeat.</p>
        <p>TRICEP PUSH-DOWN: Feet shoulder-width apart, face a high pulley machine with an attached bar/rope/strap at shoulder level height
            and grasp it with your palms facing down. Hold the bar close to your chest. This is your starting position. Keep your body stationary.
            Exhale as you lower the bar by completely extending your arms downward until the bar touches your thighs. Hold for a moment and then inhale
            as you slowly return the bar to shoulder level. Repeat.</p>
        <p>CABLE PULLOVER: Lying back on a gym bench, hold a dumbbell in both hands and raise your arms straight up above your chest. 
            From the top, let the shoulders go into 180 degrees of flexion, then drop the dumbbell straight down to fully lengthen the triceps.
            Slowly lower the dumbbell back over your head, then return to starting position.  Repeat.</p>
            <!--I wasn't sure which pullover was indicated so chose this one-->
        <p>LYING DUMBBELL TRICEP EXTENSION: Lie flat on your back on a bench and position your feet flat on the floor on either side of the bench.
            With a dumbbell in each hand, extend your arms over head until fully extended. Your palms should face one another and your hands should be close together.
            Bend the elbows and lower the weights to either side of your head.
            Extend your arms to return to the starting position.</p>
        <p>TATE PRESS: Lay flat on a bench with feet firmly planted on the floor. Clear dumbbells to your shoulders and raise them straight overhead 
            so that the dumbells are parallel with the floor and your palms are facing forward. One side of each dumbbell should touch each other.
            This is your starting position. Lower the dumbbells straight down to your chest, with the plate of each dumbbell right above your chest. 
            Your upper arms should not move and your elbows should end pointing straight outward with your palms facing forward and your thumbs on bottom.
            Slowly reverse the motion back to the starting position. Repeat.</p>
        <p>UNDERHAND TRICEPS KICK BACKS: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart while bending forward and maintaing a flat back. 
            Hold a dumbbell in each hand with an underhand grip and extend your arms to straighten them out behind you. 
            Have the elbows high and, without moving the upper arm, push the weights back and up to straight arms. Lower only to right angles. </p>
        <p>TRICEP OVERHEAD EXTENSION: Sit on a bench with back support.
            Grip a dumbbell at one end using both hands. Your palms should be facing inward.
            Hold the dumbbell overhead with your arms fully extended.  This is the the start position.
            Keep your upper arms close to your head (biceps roughly level with your temples) and near to 90degrees to the floor.
            Moving only your forearms, lower the dumbbell in a smooth arc behind your head until your forearms and biceps touch. Hold for a count of one.
            Return to the start position by using the triceps to extend your arm and raise the dumbbell. Exhale as you do this.
            Repeat.</p> <!--Wasn't sure which extension to use: barbell, or dumbell?-->
        <p>DIP: Standing between the bars of a dip station, grip the bars with an overhand grip,keeping your elbows tucked in close to your body.
            Allow your body weigh to hang so it is being supported by your arms and shoulders. Keep your hips straight.
            Push down through your palms with your arms, lifting your body up until your arms are almost straight. (Do not lock your elbows)
            Lower your body by slowly bending your elbows and continue down until you feel a slight stretch in your shoulders.
            Pause, then push yourself back to the starting position.
            Repeat.</p>
        <p>CABLE TRICEP EXTENSION: Attach a rope to the bottom pulley of a cable station.
            Grip the rope with both hands using a neutral grip. Turn your body away from the cable station.
            Fully extend your arms until your hands are directly above your head pointing to the ceiling.
            Keep your elbows  close to your head. This is the start position.
            Slowly lower the rope behind your head, keeping your upper arms stationary, inhaling as you do so.
            When your triceps are fully extended, hold for a count of one while squeezing your triceps.
            Return to the starting position by flexing your triceps  and extending your arms. Exhale as you do so.
            Repeat.</p>
        <p>CLOSE-GRIP PUSH-UP: Begin in a regular push-up position. Move hands until they are directly under your shoulders.
            Keep elbows tucked into sides. Lower body until your chest almost touches the ground, pause, then push yourself back up
            to starting position. Repeat.</p>
        <p>BARBELL SKULL CRUSHER: Holding a preacher curl barbell with an overhand grip, carefully sit on a bench. Slowly lie back and bring the barbell above your head. Make sure that your feet are flat on the floor and your core is braced.
            Keep the upper arms in place as you bend at the elbow and allow the forearms to slowly dip back towards your head.
            Once the barbell reaches the bottom, pause and slowly push the barbell back to the starting position.</p>
